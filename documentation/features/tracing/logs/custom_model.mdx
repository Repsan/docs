In Respan, we support 250+ LLMs across different providers.

Sometimes, though, you may want to:

- Use your own naming conventions (aliases) for existing models.
- Add a newly released model from a supported provider before we’ve listed it.

You can do this by creating a **custom model** in your model list.

## Why use a custom model?

Custom models let you create multiple aliases for the same underlying model.

This is useful when:

- Different use cases: Reuse the same base model but track usage separately.
- Analytics: Monitor usage by alias, not just the raw model name.
- Try new models before we've listed them.

## How to create a custom model

1. Go to the Models page and select `+ Create custom model`.
2. Fill out the form: model name, provider, costs, modality, etc.
3. Save — your custom model will now appear in the model list.
4. Copy the model ID and use it in your code.

### Copy from a base model

Instead of starting from scratch, you can also copy a base model and give it a new name.

This saves time if you just want multiple aliases of the same model without reconfiguring everything.

## FAQ

### Can I use a custom model in the LLM Gateway?
Yes — as long as it maps to a valid provider model.

Example: If OpenAI launches `gpt-6`, you can add it as a custom model and immediately call it through the AI Gateway.


### When should I use “copy base model”?
Think of it as a preset. It’s the fastest way to create aliases without re-entering configuration details.

<Step title="Example">
You can add multiple model names for the same model just like the example below. There are 3 custom models for the same base model `gpt-4o`, but you can call them independently and add 2 of them to the fallback list.
