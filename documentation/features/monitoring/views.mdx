## What are views?

**Views** are saved filter configurations. When you apply filters on [Logs](/documentation/features/tracing/logs/quickstart), [Traces](/documentation/features/tracing/traces/quickstart), [Users](/documentation/features/user-analytics/customer-identifier), [Prompts](/documentation/features/prompt-management/quickstart), or elsewhere in Respan—for example, by `status`, `model`, `user`, `timestamp`, or [custom properties](/documentation/features/tracing/logs/log-parameters#custom-properties)—you can save that filter setup as a **view**. Views let you reuse the same filters with one click instead of reconfiguring them each time.

## Where you create filters

You can set up filters in **Logs**, **Traces**, **Users**, **Prompts**, and more:

- **Logs** — Filter by status, model, user, timestamp, custom properties, and more. Use the **Filter** button on the [Logs](https://platform.respan.ai/platform/logs) page.
- **Traces** — Filter traces by workflow, metadata, customer identifier, and other fields on the [Traces](https://platform.respan.ai/platform/traces) page.
- **Users** — Filter users by identifier, usage, and related fields.
- **Prompts** — Filter prompts by name, model, and other attributes.
- **And more** — Views work across filtered surfaces throughout Respan.

Build the filter combination you care about (e.g. “production errors” or “high-cost requests”), then save it as a view.

## Use and manage views

- **Apply a view** — Select a saved view from the views list to instantly apply its filters.
- **Change filters and save** — When you’re in a view, you can change the filters, then **Save** to update the current view or **Save as new** to create a new view from the current filters.
