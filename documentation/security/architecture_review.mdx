Respan provides LLM observability service: keeping track of all the inputs to and outputs of LLM inferences, along with any additional metrics that are calculated during the inference, such as token usage, generation time etc.

## Architecture and Data Flow Overview

### Cloud Infrastructure

- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** as the primary cloud service provider
- **Application hosted on Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)**
- **Redis** for event queue management
- **PostgreSQL** for persistent data storage
- **ClickHouse** for high-performance analytics and observability data warehousing

### Data Flow

1. Client requests are sent to our API server hosted on AWS ECS
2. During LLM inference operations, events are generated and pushed to Redis queue
3. Celery workers consume these events from Redis
4. Data is batch inserted into PostgreSQL and ClickHouse

## Security and Encryption Standards

- **All API communications secured via TLS 1.2+ (HTTPS)**
- **Authentication credentials and API keys** are hashed using SHA-256 (SHA-2 family) before storage
- **Data at rest is encrypted** using AWS-managed encryption (AES-256)
- **Inter-service communication** within AWS infrastructure is secured through AWS security groups

<Accordion title="What encryption standards does Respan use?">
We implement multiple layers of encryption:
- **TLS 1.2+** for all data in transit
- **SHA-256 hashing** for data integrity verification
- **AES-256 encryption** for data at rest in our PostgreSQL databases
- All API communications are encrypted end-to-end
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How is data transmitted securely?">
All data transmission between your applications and Respan uses:
- TLS 1.2 or higher encryption protocols
- Certificate pinning for additional security
- Encrypted API keys for authentication
- Secure WebSocket connections for real-time data
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What are your data storage security practices?">
Our data storage follows enterprise security standards:
- AES-256 encryption for all data at rest
- Regular automated backups with encryption
- Database access controls and audit logging
- Network isolation and VPC security groups
</Accordion>

## Security Operations

- **Regular internal security audits** (monthly)
- **Weekly security testing** of applications
- **Continuous monitoring** via AWS CloudWatch
- **Regular code reviews** (weekly)
- **Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing** planned for next security roadmap phase

<Accordion title="What security testing do you perform?">

## Access Controls

- **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** required
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)** with least privilege
- **Just-in-time (JIT)** access for administrative functions
- **Regular access reviews** and deprovisioning

<Accordion title="How do you control access to customer data?">
We implement strict access controls:
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for all team members
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) required for all accounts
- Principle of least privilege access

</Accordion>

## Data Protection

<Accordion title="How do you handle data retention?">
Our data retention policies are designed for security and compliance:
- Configurable retention periods based on your requirements
- Automatic data purging after retention period expires

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I control what data is collected?">
Yes, you have full control over data collection:
- Configurable logging levels and data types
- Option to exclude sensitive data from logging
- Custom metadata filtering capabilities
- Real-time data masking for PII protection
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Where is my data stored geographically?">
Data storage locations are configurable:
- Primary data centers in US East (Virginia) and US West (Oregon)
- EU data residency options available
- Data never leaves your specified geographic region
- Compliance with local data sovereignty requirements
</Accordion>
