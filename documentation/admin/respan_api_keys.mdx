### Setting rate limits and spending limits
You can set the rate limits and spending limits for the API key. This will help you to manage your usage and avoid any unexpected charges.

### Setting expiration date
You can set the expiration date for the API key. This will help you to manage your API keys and avoid any security issues.

### What is Markup percentage?
Markup percentage is the percentage of the usage that you want to add to the usage of the API key. This is used to give you a better flexibility in your usage.

## Monitor API keys
You could monitor your API key usage and spending in our [dashboard](/documentation/features/monitoring/metrics). This will help you to understand your usage and spending.
